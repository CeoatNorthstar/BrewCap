## 🚀 Key Features

### ⚡️ Smart Charging

Take control of how and when your Mac charges to reduce wear and tear.

- **Sailing Mode:** Automatically stops charging at a healthier limit (e.g., 80%) and runs your Mac directly from the power adapter. This prevents micro-cycles and heat buildup, significantly extending battery life.
- **Travel Mode:** Preparing for a long trip? One click tops your battery up to 100% immediately, then automatically reverts to your safe limit after a set duration.
- **Heat Protection:** Automatically pauses charging if your battery temperature exceeds safe thresholds (e.g., 40°C), resuming only when it cools down.
- **MagSafe Integration:** The MagSafe LED provides visual feedback, pulsing or changing color to reflect charging status even when the lid is closed.

### 📊 Deep Analytics

Understand your power usage with professional-grade metrics.

- **Real-time Power Draw:** See exactly how many Watts your Mac is consuming right now.
- **Capacity Fade Tracking:** Monitor your battery's maximum capacity trend over time with detailed charts, helping you spot degradation early.
- **Battery Age & Health:** View your battery's exact age, cycle count, and health percentage calculated from raw hardware data.
- **Usage Intensity:** Get an instant "Light", "Moderate", or "Heavy" classification of your current workflow's power demand.

### 🖥️ Native Menu Bar Experience

Designed to feel like a built-in part of macOS.

- **Dynamic Icon:** The menu bar icon adapts its color (Green, Yellow, Red) based on battery level and status.
- **Customizable Display:** Cycle between Battery Percentage, Time Remaining, or Power Draw (Watts) directly in the menu bar with `⌘D`.
- **Rich Tooltips:** Hover over the icon for an instant dashboard of health, temperature, and adapter stats without even clicking.

### 📝 Data & History

Keep a record of your battery's life.

- **CSV Export:** Export your complete charging history and health data for external analysis.
- **Snapshots:** Daily snapshots of your battery's capacity are saved automatically to track long-term health.
